# LEA
A light-weight email application that uses Gmail's API, JavaMail API.

LEA is being developed in the following environments:
 - IntelliJ IDE
 - JDK version 8 update 92
 
<hr>Changelogs</hr>
Update: Prototype 2
- LEA was rebuilt using the MVC design pattern.
- A Login form was added.

PROTOTYPE:
- The app doesnt have a login form yet, so you'll need to put your login credentials in the Mail.class and build the program yourself.
